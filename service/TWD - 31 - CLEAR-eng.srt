You don't have
to come with me.

183
00:19:32,660 --> 00:19:34,660
I can handle it.

184
00:19:34,660 --> 00:19:36,660
I told your dad
I'd help you.

185
00:19:38,170 --> 00:19:40,100
Yeah, okay.

take care of that.

Mmm.

190
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:18,040
Shit.

What the hell was that?

192
00:20:28,550 --> 00:20:31,250
I want to do this
on my own.

the baby place.

195

You turn.

209
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:36,730
You just die.

I'm not wearing
a dead man's face.

229
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:01,040
I gave you this.

230
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:04,140
I said I'd turn it on
every day at dawn

231
00:24:04,140 --> 00:24:06,440
so you could find me.

232
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:13,040
Rick?

233
00:24:14,570 --> 00:24:17,170
I know you.

Oh, man.
Damn it, I--

235
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:23,310
I know you.
I know who you are.

236
00:24:24,810 --> 00:24:27,320
You said you'd turn
yours on at dawn.

237
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:29,020
That's what you said.

238
00:24:29,020 --> 00:24:32,350
I mean, I hadn't
worked up to it yet, and--

239
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:35,220
then I did.

240
00:24:37,410 --> 00:24:40,720
On the roof, every
morning for days,

241
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:43,230
for weeks,
me and my boy.

242
00:24:43,230 --> 00:24:44,830
And then...

243
00:24:47,340 --> 00:24:49,140
me.

244
00:24:50,510 --> 00:24:53,270
Just static, though.
Nothing but static.

245
00:24:53,270 --> 00:24:55,380
And then nothing
but nothing.

246
00:24:57,180 --> 00:24:59,310
You weren't there.
You were never there.

247
00:24:59,310 --> 00:25:00,950
- I was.
- No, not when I tried.

248
00:25:00,950 --> 00:25:03,280
I mean, you said you would
turn on your radio

249
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:04,820
- every day at dawn.
- Morgan, I--

250
00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:07,130
You said that you would
turn on your radio...

251
00:25:07,130 --> 00:25:08,330
- I did!
- ...every day at dawn

252
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:11,190
and you were not there!

253
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:19,560
I kept getting--
I kept getting pushed farther out.

254
00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:26,040
I had to.
I didn't have a choice.

255
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:29,010
I found my wife
and my boy.

256
00:25:29,010 --> 00:25:30,910
I had people.

257
00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:33,910
I had to keep them safe.

258
00:25:35,750 --> 00:25:38,580
We kept getting pushed back
deeper into the country.

259
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:42,790
I swear to God
I didn't have a choice.

260
00:25:42,790 --> 00:25:44,760
You can have
your radio back

261
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:48,060
'cause it looks like
I finally found you.

262
00:25:48,060 --> 00:25:51,570
You found your wife
and your son.

263
00:25:52,570 --> 00:25:54,470
That's what happened, right?
You found them.

264
00:26:00,070 --> 00:26:02,170
And did they--

265
00:26:02,170 --> 00:26:04,610
Did she--
did your wife--

266
00:26:04,610 --> 00:26:06,540
did she turn?

267
00:26:08,450 --> 00:26:11,110
No, she died.

268
00:26:12,850 --> 00:26:16,050
So you didn't have
to see that, then.

269
00:26:16,050 --> 00:26:18,120
Of course not.

270
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:20,890

Not like me.

271
00:26:20,890 --> 00:26:23,490
( laughs )
No.

272
00:26:23,490 --> 00:26:27,200
Not like me.
Not like my wife.

273
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:29,100
You remember
what happened to her?

274
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:33,600
You remember
what she was?

275
00:26:34,940 --> 00:26:36,740
Yeah.

276
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:43,880
Oh.

277
00:26:46,150 --> 00:26:48,120
You gave me the gun.

278
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:50,620
You tried.

279
00:26:50,620 --> 00:26:52,720
What did I try, Morgan?

280
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:55,090
( laughs )
What did I try?

281
00:26:55,090 --> 00:26:58,120
You tried to get me to do it
'cause I was supposed to do it.

282
00:26:58,130 --> 00:27:00,860
I was supposed
to kill her, my Jenny.

283
00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:04,160
Knew I was supposed to,
but I let it go.

284
00:27:05,570 --> 00:27:08,270
Let it go like there wasn't
gonna be a reckoning.

285
00:27:12,310 --> 00:27:14,040
We was always
looking for food.

286
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:16,440
You know, it always
came down to food.

287
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:18,640
And I was--

288
00:27:18,650 --> 00:27:20,950
I was checking out
a cellar

289
00:27:20,950 --> 00:27:23,580
and I didn't want Duane
to come down there with me.

290
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:25,950
And then when I came up...

291
00:27:27,950 --> 00:27:31,360
she was standing there
right in front of him

292
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:34,460
and he had his gun up

293
00:27:34,460 --> 00:27:37,090
and he couldn't do it.

294
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:40,830
So I called to him

295
00:27:40,830 --> 00:27:42,800
and he turned.

296
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:44,800
And then she was just--

297
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:47,500
just on him.

298
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:50,610
And I see red.
I see red.

299
00:27:50,610 --> 00:27:54,140
Everything is red.
Everything I see is red.

300
00:27:54,140 --> 00:27:55,910
And I do it.

301
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:00,350
Finally.

302
00:28:01,650 --> 00:28:03,850
Finally was too late.

303
00:28:07,990 --> 00:28:09,660
I was supposed to.

304
00:28:11,490 --> 00:28:13,430
I was selfish.

305
00:28:13,430 --> 00:28:15,160
I was weak.

306
00:28:20,570 --> 00:28:23,300
You gave me the gun.

307
00:28:27,310 --> 00:28:29,780
Hey, your boy--

308
00:28:29,780 --> 00:28:31,480
is he dead?

309
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:36,650
- No.
- No?

310
00:28:36,650 --> 00:28:38,520
He will be.

311
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:40,450
See, 'cause people
like you,

312
00:28:40,450 --> 00:28:43,290
the good people,
they always die.

313
00:28:43,290 --> 00:28:46,160
And the bad people do, too.

314
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:49,230
But the weak people,

315
00:28:49,230 --> 00:28:51,500
the people like me...

You think I was gonna
let you go in there?

319

I just think it's none
of your business.

320
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:55,400
You don't know me.
You don't know my dad.

321
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:57,170
I came out here to help.

322
00:29:57,170 --> 00:29:59,600
You came out here
for common interests.

We have the same enemy
and the same problem.

324

And that's why you're here.
That's it.

325
00:30:03,610 --> 00:30:05,880
This is important.

326
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:09,180
I'm going to do this.

327
00:30:09,180 --> 00:30:10,850

to come back with us.

363
00:34:32,130 --> 00:34:34,460
( laughs )

364
00:34:34,460 --> 00:34:36,800
After all that?

365
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:38,530
After me trying to blow
your head off,

366
00:34:38,530 --> 00:34:41,200
stab your heart out,
happily ever after together?

367
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:42,830
You couldn't kill me,
I couldn't kill you.

368
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:44,300
I'll take that
as a sign.

369
00:34:46,010 --> 00:34:48,040
Huh.

370
00:34:49,640 --> 00:34:52,040
We found a prison.

371
00:34:52,050 --> 00:34:54,480
The fences
can keep 'em out.

372
00:34:57,220 --> 00:34:59,220
Is that where your wife died?

373
00:35:03,420 --> 00:35:05,220
Just go.

374
00:35:05,220 --> 00:35:06,920
Don't go back.
Don't stop.

375
00:35:06,930 --> 00:35:09,530
<i>Just get yourself</i>
<i>some more time.</i>

376
00:35:09,530 --> 00:35:12,330
Look, I can help you.

377
00:35:12,330 --> 00:35:14,460
You can come back with us.
You can heal.

378
00:35:14,470 --> 00:35:16,230
You're taking a lot
of guns, Rick.

379
00:35:16,230 --> 00:35:20,440
No, I'm just saying that
that all is a lot of guns.

380
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:23,270
Why do you need
the guns, Rick?

381
00:35:23,270 --> 00:35:25,240
'Cause if you got
something good,

382
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:27,610
that just means that there's
someone who wants to take it.

383
00:35:27,610 --> 00:35:30,110
And that is what
is happening, right?

384
00:35:30,110 --> 00:35:31,910
We're gonna win.
( chuckles )

385
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:34,620
You can be there.
You can help.

386
00:35:34,620 --> 00:35:38,020
You will be torn apart
by teeth or bullets.

387
00:35:38,020 --> 00:35:40,320
You and your boy.

388
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:42,960
Your people,
but not me.

389
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:45,790
Because I am not gonna
watch that happen again.

390
00:35:50,670 --> 00:35:52,430
Man, you take the guns.

391
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:55,040
You know there's a chance.
That's what you can't square.

392
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:56,540
That's what hurts.

393
00:35:56,540 --> 00:35:58,840
You know there's a chance!

394
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:01,110
I don't think you heard
a damn word that I said!

395
00:36:07,550 --> 00:36:11,050
We both started out
in the same place.

396
00:36:11,050 --> 00:36:14,620
Things went bad for you,
things went bad for me.

397
00:36:14,620 --> 00:36:18,460
But you're not
seeing things right.

398
00:36:18,460 --> 00:36:20,560
I don't blame you,
what you've lost,

399
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:22,160
what you've been through.

400
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:23,700
You're not
seeing things right,

401
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:26,130
but you can come back from this,
I know you can.

402
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:30,100
You have to.

403
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:32,240
This can't be it.

404
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:35,170
It can't be.

405
00:36:35,170 --> 00:36:37,410
You got to be able
to come back from this.

406
00:36:40,310 --> 00:36:42,210
- No.
- Morgan, please.

407
00:36:42,220 --> 00:36:43,880
No!

408
00:36:45,150 --> 00:36:46,920
I have to clear.

409
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:49,020
That's why
I didn't die today.

410
00:36:49,020 --> 00:36:50,490
That's the sign.

411
00:36:50,490 --> 00:36:53,020
I have to, man.
I have to.

412
00:36:56,260 --> 00:36:58,530
I have to clear.

413
00:37:21,820 --> 00:37:23,820
( growling )

414
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:35,160
Hey.

415
00:37:35,170 --> 00:37:37,230
I was just about
to look for you.

416
00:37:37,230 --> 00:37:39,600
- Sorry.
- It's all right.

417
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:41,500
You're here now.

418
00:37:44,940 --> 00:37:47,610
Oh, it's nothing.

419
00:37:51,650 --> 00:37:53,620
Thank you.

420
00:38:07,530 --> 00:38:09,430
He's okay?

421
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,830
No, he's not.

422
00:38:19,210 --> 00:38:21,680
Wait.
Hey.

423
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:24,040
- Carl.
- Morgan.

424
00:38:27,010 --> 00:38:29,220
I had to shoot you.

425
00:38:29,220 --> 00:38:31,220
You know I had to, right?

426
00:38:33,490 --> 00:38:37,390
I'm sorry.

427
00:38:37,390 --> 00:38:39,830
Hey, son.

428
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:43,400
Don't ever be sorry.

429
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:13,190
Everything okay with her?

430
00:39:14,690 --> 00:39:16,790
I think she might
be one of us.

431
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:19,560
What?

432
00:39:22,530 --> 00:39:24,770
Everything went okay.

433
00:39:24,770 --> 00:39:27,200
( chuckles )

434
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:30,210
Hop in.
I'll throw this in the back.

435
00:39:54,130 --> 00:39:56,230
You see something?

436
00:39:59,740 --> 00:40:02,300
I know you see things.

437
00:40:02,300 --> 00:40:03,910
People.

438
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:10,810
I used to talk
to my dead boyfriend.

439
00:40:12,550 --> 00:40:14,280
It happens.

440
00:40:17,650 --> 00:40:19,190
You want to drive?

441
00:40:19,190 --> 00:40:21,320
Yeah.

442
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:23,490
Good.

443
00:40:23,490 --> 00:40:25,760
I see things.
